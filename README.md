# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a **House Price Prediction System** built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It uses a dataset of house features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location to train a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a house.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **end-to-end machine learning deployment** â€” from **data ingestion and preprocessing** to **model training** and finally **deploying an interactive web application** using Streamlit.

The app allows users to **input property details** and get an **instant predicted price** based on historical data patterns.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Trains a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) on historical housing data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit app for interactive predictions.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Instantly estimates house prices based on user inputs.
- **Customizable Model**: Easily swap out the regression model for experimentation.

## Business & Analytical Questions Answered
This project not only predicts house prices but also addresses key real estate questions:
1. **What features influence house prices the most?**  
   - Understand how bedrooms, location, size, and amenities impact pricing.
2. **How much does location matter?**  
   - Quantify the effect of neighborhoods or cities on house prices.
3. **What is the price range for houses with similar characteristics?**  
   - Compare market values for similar properties.
4. **Can we estimate a competitive selling price for a property?**  
   - Help sellers avoid overpricing or underpricing their listings.
5. **How do property features interact?**  
   - See how combinations (e.g., more bathrooms but smaller size) affect the price.
6. **What is the expected ROI for property investments in specific areas?**  
   - Provide insights for real estate investors.
7. **How can buyers identify undervalued properties?**  
   - Spot properties priced below predicted market value.
